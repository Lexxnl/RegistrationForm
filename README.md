# Registration Form

This project is a simple **Registration Form** created for learning purposes, helping me practice HTML and CSS by simulating a user registration process. It is built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my journey to learn web development through **freeCodeCamp**.

## Description

The **Registration Form** includes the following fields:
- **First and Last Name**: Users are required to enter their full name.
- **Email**: A valid email is required for the registration.
- **Password**: A password with a minimum of 8 characters is needed for security.
- **Account Type**: Users can select either a **Personal** or **Business** account.
- **Profile Picture**: Users can upload a profile picture.
- **Age**: Users must be at least 13 years old to register.
- **Referrer**: A dropdown allows users to choose how they heard about the website.
- **Bio**: Users can provide a short bio about themselves.
- **Terms and Conditions**: A checkbox confirms users' agreement to the terms.

The form uses various HTML input types, including text, email, password, file upload, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a select dropdown.

## What I Learned

- **HTML Forms**: Creating interactive forms with different types of inputs (text, password, email, file, etc.).
- **Form Validation**: Using the `required` attribute and pattern matching for password validation.
- **Fieldsets and Legends**: Organizing form inputs in groups for better clarity.
- **CSS Styling**: Enhancing the form's appearance with custom styles, including background color, borders, and layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the form looks good on different screen sizes by using relative units for width and height.

## Why This is Helpful for Getting Hired

1. **Form Handling**: Forms are an essential part of web applications, particularly in user registration, authentication, and data collection. Employers look for developers who can design functional and accessible forms.
   
2. **CSS Layout and Styling**: Being able to style forms effectively is important for creating polished, user-friendly websites.
   
3. **Input Validation**: Demonstrating an understanding of form validation is a key skill in web development.
   
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that your forms work well on all devices is an increasingly important skill in modern web development.
